### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This PHP-ML example uses the NaiveBayes Classifier to make predictions and is used under the profile page of colornos.com

NaiveBayes Classifier is based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

Feel free to update and make it better. I dare you.

Thanks,
Team Colornos
